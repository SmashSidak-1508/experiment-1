        Expert Advice Disclaimer
        <br></br>
Welcome to Wellness Wayfinder! Our platform connects you with experienced wellness experts who provide online consultations. It's important to note that these consultations are designed to complement, not replace, in-person medical visits. They serve as a convenient option for obtaining expert advice, personalized wellness guidance, and assistance with your well-being journey.
<br></br>
Key Points:
<br></br>
1.Supplementary to In-Person Visits: Online consultations offered on Wellness Wayfinder are not intended to replace traditional, in-person medical visits. They are an additional and convenient option for seeking expert advice and guidance.
<br></br>
2.Medical Advice and Prescriptions: Our expert doctors can provide medical advice, prescribe medications when necessary, and offer guidance on various aspects of well-being. However, they do not substitute for face-to-face interactions with a healthcare professional for comprehensive physical examinations.
<br></br>
Importance of Accurate Information: To receive the best possible care, it is crucial to provide accurate and complete information during the online consultation. This includes details about your medical history, symptoms, and any other relevant information. This helps our experts provide more precise advice tailored to your individual needs.
<br></br>
Important Considerations:
<br></br>
1.Emergency Situations: In case of a medical emergency, please seek immediate medical attention. Online consultations are not suitable for urgent or emergency situations.
<br></br>
2.Continuity of Care: Online consultations can be part of your wellness journey, but it's essential to maintain regular in-person check-ups with your primary care physician for ongoing health management.
<br></br>
3.Privacy and Confidentiality: We prioritize the security and confidentiality of your information. Our platform follows strict privacy policies to protect your data.
